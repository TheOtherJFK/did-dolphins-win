# Did the Dolphins Win a Game?

The Dolphins are still the Dolphins - save time and avoid watching another blowout!

This Flutter app sends a notification when the Dolphins win a game.

It uses realtime data from MySportsFeeds to show scores and determine when to send a notification.

The main purpose of this app (aside from poking fun at the Miami Dolphins) is:

- Get to know Google's Firebase Cloud Messenger service to send notifications.
- Learn the best way to manage user preferences (storing State is a hot topic in Flutter right now)
- Experiment with Streams and Futures
